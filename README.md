# About

**React Native** project developed as one of the challenges during my **Ignite bootcamp** with [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

- This app provides a list of exercises per body area, and each exercise suggests the number and 
**series** and **repetitions**. 
- Furthermore, you can mark the exercise as **completed** which creates your exercises **history**.
- On the **History** page it displays the exercises per day in a **Section List**.  
- On the **Profile** page you can set a **profile picture** by uploading it from your device.
- You can only access the exercises if you are **authenticated** (App routes/private), otherwise you are displayed with the **SignIn** or **SignUp** pages (Auth routes /public).
- Furthermore, **Notifications**, **Deep Linking** and **Expo Dev Client** were added to this project as explained below.

## OneSignal
 **OneSignal** delivers **notifications messages** to both **ios** and **android**.
 - In order to setup the **android** environment to use **notifications messages** I used a free could service from Google, **FCM v1(legacy)**, Firebase Cloud Messaging. (firebase.google.com) 
 - In order to setup the **ios** environment for **notifications messages**, we would need to use an **Apple developer account** to utilize their cloud messaging service which is called **APNS-Apple Push Notification Service**, so on this project only android was used.

## Deep Linking
Deep linking was also used on this project, so a **scheme** was setup for the project, then I used the **npx uri-scheme list** command to verify the scheme creation and **npx uri-scheme open** to open the **url**.
Also, in order to integrate the React Navigation with **Deep Linking** we configured the routes and their params to a **linking** object and passed it to the **NavigationContainer linking property**, so we when **Deep Linking with params** is passed through **OneSignal** the user is directed to specifics screens.
In order to help generate the deep linking url, **expo-linking** lib was used.

## Expo Dev Client
**Expo Dev Client** is a new **Expo** feature that allows you to use all its integrated **libs** plus the **libs** that are not support by **Expo**, like third party libraries. In this project **OneSignal** is one example as it is a **native lib**, but we ran it with expo, thanks to **Expo Dev Client** . So basically we generate a **customized Expo Go development build** when running the project with **expo-dev-client**.


*Prerequisites:* 
1 - **ios** and **android** folders must have been generated. In other words, **expo prebuild** must had run.
2 -Must had generated a **build** with a native code (**npx expo run: android**, **npx expo run:ios**)
3 - Install **Expo Dev Client** and run **npx expo start --dev-client**. **Expo** will look for the **build with the native code** and run it with **Expo**.


 # Motivation


- Practice ***React Navigation v6*** (***Stack Navigation and BottomTab Navigation*** were used).
- Learn and practice styling with **Native Base** .
- Practice **AsyncStorage** to store user, token and refresh_token.
- Practice **Expo Image Picker**.
- Learn and practice sending **notifications** with **OneSignal**. 
- Learn to configure and use **Deep Linking** to send notifications through **OneSignal**.
- Learn and practice on how to produce a customized build with **expo dev client**.
- Interact with the Dev Community, learn together and progress as a Developer.
- Keep committed with my goals.</br>
